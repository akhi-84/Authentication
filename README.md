Here’s a professional README.md file based on your given steps and points for RBAC project:

LOGIN CREDENTIALS of THESE PROJECT:
USERNAME: admin@gmail.com
PASSWORD : 123

##steps to run these code:

1. firstly we install the codeigniter3 and XAMPP server from google chrome.
2. After downloading XAMPP server to run the apache and mysql and go to the google chrome open the localhost/phpmyadmin.
3. In localhost to create the database is admin in admin database create the users table.
4. After creation of users table to run in the browser, project url("http://localhost/project-foldername").

# Authentication System in CodeIgniter 3

This project implements a secure and functional user authentication system using CodeIgniter 3. Below are the detailed steps and features of the system.

## Features
- User authentication with secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing access to protected pages.
- Session management for tracking user activity and login status.
- Login and logout functionality with proper redirects.
- Validation and error handling using CodeIgniter's form validation library.
- Flash messages for user feedback (e.g., invalid credentials, successful login).
- Organized folder structure for easy scalability.

## Steps to Set Up

### 1. *Set Up the Database*
Create the users table to store user information. Use the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    email varchar(100) NOT NULL,
    password varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
2. Create Folder Structure
Organize your project as follows:

Controllers: Auth.php (handles login/logout), Dashboard.php (protected dashboard).
Models: User_model.php (handles database queries and user validation).
Views: login.php (login form), index.php (dashboard or homepage).
3. Create the Login Form (View)
The login form (login.php) includes:

A field for the username.
A field for the password.
A submit button.
Upon submission, the form sends data to the Auth controller.

4. Authentication Controller
Key tasks in the Auth controller:

Validate form inputs using CodeIgniter's validation library.
Check user credentials through the User_model.
If valid:
Start a session and store user data.
Redirect to the protected dashboard.
If invalid:
Display error messages using flash messages.

5. User Model for Validation
The User_model interacts with the database:

Queries the users table for matching credentials.
Verifies the hashed password using PHP’s password verification functions.
Returns user data on success or false on failure.

6. Session Management
Use CodeIgniter’s session library for tracking login status.
Store user data (e.g., username, ID) in the session after successful login.
Configure the session settings in application/config/config.php.

7. Protect Routes
For protected pages (e.g., Dashboard.php):

Check if the user is logged in by verifying session data.
Redirect unauthorized users to the login page.

8. Logout Functionality
Create a logout method in the Auth controller to destroy session data.
Redirect the user to the login page after logging out.

9. Testing the System
Login: Verify credentials are validated, and sessions are started correctly.
Session Management: Ensure protected routes are accessible only when logged in.
Logout: Confirm session destruction and redirection after logout.

## Additional Enhancements:
Password Hashing: Ensure all passwords are securely hashed (e.g., using bcrypt).
RBAC: Add role-based access control to restrict certain actions or pages based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).
Input Validation: Use CodeIgniter’s validation library to sanitize and validate inputs.
Flash Messages: Provide meaningful feedback on actions (e.g., “Invalid Credentials” or “Login Successful”).
Security Measures: Consider advanced security practices like multi-factor authentication for enhanced protection.

## Conclusion:
This authentication system provides a secure and scalable foundation for user management in CodeIgniter 3. 
It is flexible and can be extended with additional features such as role management, email verification, or account recovery mechanisms.

This README.md presents the authentication system in a professional format, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for developers.
